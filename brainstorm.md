### Builder Game

Necessarily extremely simple, grid-based game, used to learn JavaScript.
Ideally no different maps; just the same screen for a continuous game.

* Perhaps have a Beaver build a dam...
  * Random distribution of materials
  * Flood area, avoid den collapsing.

* Anti-snake game?
  * Avoid snake/fox by building den/blocking route
  * simply have to collect materials and avoid snake
  * random distribution of materials initially
  * drag and drop mechanic (possibly with change of form)
  *
